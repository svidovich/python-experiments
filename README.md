# python-experiments

Sometimes I want to answer a question about Python, be it performance or how some underlying machinery works. I think I'll capture it here.

## generation_accumulation

I was wondering what the performance difference ( wrt memory ) was when using generators vs when using accumulators, so I designed a quick test.

## streaming_generators

I wanted to test out all of the different features of generators, so I built a data pipeline centered around generators. It's built with python, docker-compose, and various technologies, and is ( somewhat ) extensible.

## kaiser-roll

I wanted to make a uh. Caeser cipher thing, so I did. It works pretty good, but the code sucks, lol.
