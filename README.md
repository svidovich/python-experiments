# python-experiments

Sometimes I want to answer a question about Python, be it performance or how some underlying machinery works. I think I'll capture it here.


## generation_accumulation

I was wondering what the performance difference ( wrt memory ) was when using generators vs when using accumulators, so I designed a quick test.
